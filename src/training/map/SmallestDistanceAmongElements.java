    # Shortest Distance Number Repeated

    You are given an array of integers. Your task is to find the smallest distance between any two identical numbers in the array. If there are no repeated numbers, return `-1`.

    The distance between two positions is calculated as the absolute difference between their indices.

    Example 1:
    Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 3]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The number 2 appears at index 1 and index 4, with a distance of 3. The number 3 appears at index 2 and index 6, with a distance of 4. The smallest distance is 3.

    Example 2:
    Input: numbers = [7, 8, 9]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: Since no number is repeated in the array, the output is -1.

    Example 3:
    Input: numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The number 1 appears at adjacent positions, giving a minimum distance of 1.

    Example 4:
    Input: numbers = [1, 1, 2, 1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The number 1 appears at positions 0, 1, and 3. The minimum distance is 1 (between positions 0 and 1).

    Constraints:

    - The length of numbers is at most `10^5`
    - Each element in numbers is an integer between `-10^9` and `10^9`
