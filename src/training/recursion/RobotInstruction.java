Hello! Your interview question is below. Write code in this pad just like you would normally â€“ your AI Interviewer will be able to see it.

# Robot Instructions

We are given a string, `seq`, with a sequence of instructions for a robot.
The string consists of characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'2'`. The letters `'L'` and `'R'` instruct the robot to move left or right.

The character `'2'` (which never appears at the end of the string) means "perform all the instructions after this `'2'` twice, but skip the instruction immediately following the `'2'` during the second repetition." Output a string with the final list of left and right moves that the robot should do.

Example 1: seq = "LL"
Output: "LL"

Example 2: seq = "2LR"
Output: "LRR". The '2' indicates that we need to do "LR" first and then "R".

Example 3: seq = "2L"
Output: "L". The '2' indicates that we need to do "L" first and then "" (the empty string).

Example 4: seq = "22LR"
Output: "LRRLR". The first '2' indicates that we need to do "2LR" first and then "LR".

Example 5: seq = "LL2R2L"
Output: "LLRLL"

Constraints:

- The length of `seq` is at most `10^4`
- `seq` consists only of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'2'`
- `'2'` never appears at the end of `seq`
